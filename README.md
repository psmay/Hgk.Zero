This is a library primarily for use with C# that provides utilities I
generally don't want to be without. Currently, this consists of:

*   [Hgk.Zero.Options](docfx/api/Hgk.Zero.Options.html), which provides
    LINQ-enabled enumerable containers which contain zero elements or
    one element, enabling a more fluent alternative to
    `TryGetValue`/`TryParse` methods and
    `ElementAt`/`First`/`Last`/`Single` filters.
*   [Hgk.Zero.Strings](docfx/api/Hgk.Zero.Strings.html), which makes the
    functionality of the static `String.Concat()` and `String.Join()`
    methods available as extension methods on strings and enumerables.
